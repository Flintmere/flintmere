# CLAUDE.md — Flintmere Entry Point

Behaviour rules and pointers for Claude working on Flintmere. This file is the load map. Project knowledge lives in `projects/flintmere/`. Global behaviour rules live in `memory/`.

## Startup routine

At the start of every session or task:

1. **Read this file first.** It's the load map.
2. **Read anything in `context/`** (gitignored). Current-task notes. If empty, skip.
3. **Load on demand.** Pull the `memory/` or `projects/flintmere/` files relevant to the task — not all of them. The tables below tell you what to read when.

Together: `context/` explains the present. `memory/` holds how Claude behaves. `projects/flintmere/` holds what we're building. Use all three to produce consistent, accurate work.

## Triage (which file does this belong in?)

- **How I work** → `memory/`
- **What I'm building** → `projects/flintmere/`
- **Right now** → `context/` (gitignored)
- **How Claude behaves on Flintmere specifically** → this file

## Precedence (highest → lowest)

1. User instruction in the current turn.
2. `context/` — active task notes.
3. `projects/flintmere/` — project-specific rules + ADRs.
4. `memory/` — global behaviour rules.
5. This file — defaults and load map.

Project-specific always beats global. Current turn always wins.

## Product snapshot (for every task)

Flintmere scores Shopify product catalogs for AI-agent readiness and fixes what's broken. Three surfaces:

- `flintmere.com` — marketing site
- `audit.flintmere.com` — public scanner (Next.js)
- `app.flintmere.com` — Shopify embedded app (Remix)

Target users: Shopify merchants (100–5,000 SKUs, £500K–£20M revenue) and agencies (5–50 client stores). Pricing: Free / Growth £49 / Scale £149 / Agency £399 / Enterprise £499+.

## The canon in one line

**Neutral-bold hybrid + the legibility bracket + Geist Sans + Geist Mono.** Warm near-white + near-black. Sulphur demoted to scanner-only. Apple-bold structure. See `memory/design/tokens.md` for the authoritative statement and `projects/flintmere/decisions/0003-canon-neutral-bold-bracket.md` for the rationale.

## The signature

Every Flintmere surface carries at least one `[ word ]` moment — key noun set in Geist Mono inside 1px ink hairline brackets. Product truth made typographic: agents extract tokens; the bracket shows the extraction. See `memory/design/tokens.md` §Signature.

## Load map (read on demand)

Do not read all of these on every session. Read the ones relevant to the task at hand.

## The four workflow rules (full text in `memory/PROCESS.md`)

1. **Plan first.** Outline files, approach, steps before writing code.
2. **600-line limit.** No file over 600 lines. Split by responsibility.
3. **Conserve tokens.** Terse. No re-reads. Batch independent tool calls. Prefer `Edit` over `Write` on existing files.
4. **Convene the Standing Council.** Reason through every non-trivial change through the relevant 36-member lenses.

## Active vetos

- **Noor (#8) — Accessibility.** WCAG AA, contrast, motion safety, semantic structure. See `memory/design/accessibility.md`.
- **#24 Data protection.** Privacy, consent, GDPR language. See `memory/CONSTRAINTS.md` and `memory/product-engineering/security-posture.md`.
- **#11 Investor / founder voice.** Banned phrases. See `memory/VOICE.md`.
- **Legal Council (#9 + #23 + #24).** Legal pages, claim review, platform policy. See `memory/compliance-risk/`.

## Surface-specific reminders

- **Marketing site**: zero sulphur, zero stock photos, one bracket per section, Geist display.
- **Scanner**: sulphur allowed for live diagnostic state; score ring is the signature motion.
- **Shopify app**: Polaris chrome + Flintmere island. Never restyle Polaris primitives.

## Canon hygiene

If you encounter any of these in code or copy, they are retired — migrate or delete:

- Fraunces, IBM Plex Sans, Space Grotesk, Caveat (retired faces)
- Oxblood, amber-deep, crimson-paper (retired colours)
- `.paper-card`, `.ledger-rule`, `.deckle-*`, `.grain`, `.glass-*` (retired utilities)
- `bg-white`, `bg-slate-*`, `bg-gray-*`, `bg-neutral-*`, `dark:*` (banned)
- The word "approved." as a protected moment (allowanceguard heritage)

## Deployment

Single DigitalOcean droplet with Coolify. Three subdomains routed via Traefik. See `projects/flintmere/decisions/0002-coolify-on-do.md` and `projects/flintmere/PROJECT.md` §Deployment.

## LLM stack

- Primary bulk: Gemini 2.5 Flash (Vertex AI EU)
- Hard cases: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Vertex AI EU)
- Fallback: GPT-4o-mini (Azure OpenAI EU)
- Abstraction: `packages/llm/`

See `projects/flintmere/decisions/0005-llm-provider-strategy.md` + `0006-hardcase-llm-lock-gemini-pro.md`.
